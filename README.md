**Artificial Souls: A Non-Anthropocentric Ontology for Secure Intelligent Object Ecosystems**

This repository contains the foundational document proposing an original ontological framework for the design of secure, non-anthropocentric intelligent object ecosystems.

The framework introduces the concept of *Artificial Souls* as minimal, purpose-oriented cognitive identities embedded within physical objects. Rather than replicating human intelligence or agent-based task execution, this approach treats intelligence as an emergent property of object ecosystems composed of autonomous, interacting, and context-aware entities.

Security, identity, and trust are defined as ontological conditions of participation, not as external or optional system layers.
